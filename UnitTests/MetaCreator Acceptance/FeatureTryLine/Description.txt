Some languages, like sh, BAT have not exception handling

for example, I'd like to have similar behaviour in line:

Dispose()
{
	_client.GetStream().Close();
	_client.Client.Close();
	_client.Close();
	_receivedResponsesNew.Dispose();
	_receivedResponsesReaded.Dispose();
	_threadReceiver.Dispose();
	_sendingQueueNew.Dispose();
}

If I wrap around every line with catch and null comparer - I'l get 11 lines from 1, totally 77 lines of code instead of thouse 7.

To simplify that, I'd like to use block

Dispose()
{
	/*# trap
	catch(Exception ex)
	{
		// Statements that execute in the event of an exception
	}*/
	{
		_client.GetStream().Close();
		_client.Client.Close();
		_client.Close();
		_receivedResponsesNew.Dispose();
		_receivedResponsesReaded.Dispose();
		_threadReceiver.Dispose();
		_sendingQueueNew.Dispose();
	}
}
